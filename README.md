# Star-Predictor
This project uses Artificial Neural Networks to predict the star type of a star given the dataset of star types. This project can be useful for scientific purposes such as astronomy. Firstly, the seven input one output ANN Model is constructed, then the networks are trained by the given data, followed by being optimized. After that, itâ€™s validated by the testing dataset, and then it shows the prediction of the star type accordingly. Moreover, the result is also compared with 4 other models for accuracy, efficiency, and performance purposes. This project has been purely written in MATLAB using MATLAB Toolboxes and Programming.
